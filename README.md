## Getting Started

Hello everyone,

this is an entry level of banking application for the means of exercising.

I'll update it from time to time with new lines of codes. You are free to push your suggestions as well.

Every little suggestion or improvement on your part will be a big help and a great lesson for me.

Enjoy yourself!



## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
